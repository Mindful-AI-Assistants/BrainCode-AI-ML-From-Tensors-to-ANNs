# How to Automate Data Updates in Excel Solver

You can automate the execution of Solver in Excel using **VBA macros**, allowing Solver to run automatically whenever your data changes or when the workbook is opened.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Automate Solver

### 1. **Record a Solver Macro**

- **Enable the Developer Tab** (if necessary, go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon > Check "Developer").
- Go to **Developer > Record Macro**.
- Manually run Solver as usual, setting up your model.
- Stop recording. This generates the VBA code to run Solver.


### 2. **Edit the Macro**

- Open the VBA Editor (Alt + F11).
- Find the recorded macro and adapt it as needed.
- Example VBA code to run Solver:

```vba
Sub RunSolver()
    SolverOk SetCell:="$K$2", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ByChange:="$G$2:$I$4", _
        Engine:=1, EngineDesc:="Simplex LP"
    SolverSolve True
End Sub
```

- Adjust the cell references to match your model.


### 3. **Automate Execution**

- To run Solver whenever your data changes, use the `Worksheet_Change` event in VBA:

```vba
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    If Not Intersect(Target, Range("B2:D4")) Is Nothing Then
        Call RunSolver
    End If
End Sub
```

- This will run Solver every time data in the range B2:D4 is changed.


### 4. **Add Data Update (Optional)**

- If your data comes from external sources (Power Query, connections, etc.), configure automatic updates in the connection properties (Data > Connection Properties), or use VBA to refresh the data before running Solver.

## Summary

- **Record and edit a Solver macro.**
- **Use VBA to automate Solver execution** (for example, when data changes).
- **Set up automatic data updates** if necessary.

This way, your Excel Solver model becomes fully automated, always displaying the most current solution.
