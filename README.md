# Artificial Neural Networks â€“ Gradient Descent

This repository provides a comprehensive explanation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), focusing on the perceptron and multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, and the Gradient Descent algorithm for training. The content is based on the [Decreasing-Gradient.pdf](./Decreasing-Gradient.pdf) document.

<br>

## Motivation

The human brain processes information in a highly complex, nonlinear, and parallel way, which is fundamentally different from conventional digital computers. For example, tasks such as visual recognition (e.g., recognizing a familiar face in an unfamiliar scene) are performed by the brain in milliseconds, while much simpler tasks can take a conventional computer days to complete.

At birth, a child's brain has a large structure and the ability to develop its own rules through experience. ANNs are computational machines designed to model or simulate the way the brain performs specific tasks or functions of interest.

<br>

## Historical Context

- **McCulloch & Pitts (1943):** Introduced the first neural network models.
- **Hebb (1949):** Developed the basic model of self-organization.
- **Rosenblatt (1958):** Introduced the perceptron, a supervised learning model.
- **Hopfield (1982), Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams:** Revived the field with symmetric networks for optimization and the backpropagation method.
  
<br>

## Artificial Neuron Model

### Each artificial neuron receives input signals $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$ (binary or real values), each multiplied by a weight $w_1, w_2, ..., w_p$ (real values). The neuron computes a weighted sum (activity level):

$$a = w_1 X_1 + w_2 X_2 + \cdots + w_p X_p
$$


```latex
\a = w_1 X_1 + w_2 X_2 + \cdots + w_p X_p\
```

<br>

### The output $y$ is determined by an activation function, such as:

$$
y =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } a \geq t \\
0, & \text{if } a < t
\end{cases}
$$

```latex
y =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } a \geq t \\
0, & \text{if } a < t
\end{cases}
```
  
<br>


## Key Benefits of ANNs

- Adaptability through learning
- Ability to operate with partial knowledge
- Fault tolerance
- Generalization
- Contextual information processing
- Input-output mapping

## Application Areas

- Pattern classification
- Clustering/categorization
- Function approximation
- Prediction
- Optimization
- Content-addressable memory
- Control systems

  <br>

## Learning Process

ANNs operate in two main phases:

1. **Training Phase:** The network learns by adjusting its free parameters (weights) to perform a specific function.
2. **Application Phase:** The trained network is used for its intended purpose (e.g., pattern or image classification).

## The learning process involves:

1. Stimulation by the environment (input).
2. Modification of free parameters (weights) as a result.
3. The network responds differently due to internal changes.

Learning is governed by a set of pre-established rules (learning algorithm) and a learning paradigm (model).

<br>

## Error Correction Learning

The output of neuron $k$ at iteration $n$ is $y_k(n)$, and the desired response is $d_k(n)$. The error signal is:

$$
e_k(n) = d_k(n) - y_k(n)
$$

The goal is to minimize the cost function (performance index):

$$
E(n) = \frac{1}{2} e_k^2(n)
$$

Weights are updated as:

$$
w_{kj}(n+1) = w_{kj}(n) + \Delta w_{kj}(n)
$$

<br>

# The Perceptron

The perceptron, proposed by Rosenblatt (1958), is the simplest type of ANN. It uses supervised learning and error correction to adjust the weight vector. For a perceptron with two inputs and a bias:

- The bias allows the threshold value in the activation function to be set, and is updated like any other weight.

<br>

## Nonlinearities and Activation Functions

- Nonlinearities are inherent in most real-world problems.
- Incorporated through nonlinear activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, tanh) and multiple layers.
- MLPs use sigmoid functions in hidden layers and linear functions in the output layer.

<br>

## MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron)

- Composed of neurons with nonlinear activation functions in intermediate (hidden) layers.
- Only the output layer receives a desired output during training.
- The error for hidden layers is estimated by the effect they cause on the output error (backpropagation).

<br>

# Two-Layer Perceptron Architecture

A two-layer perceptron (MLP with one hidden layer and one output layer) can approximate any function, linear or not (Cybenko, 1989). 

- **Layer 1 (Hidden/Intermediate):** Each neuron contributes lines (hyperplanes) to form surfaces in input space, "linearizing" the features.
- **Layer 2 (Output):** Neurons combine these lines to form convex regions, enabling complex decision boundaries.

**Number of Neurons:**  
- The generalization capacity of the network increases with the number of neurons.
- Empirically, 3â€“5 neurons per layer strike a good balance between modeling power and computational cost.

**Layer Types:**
- **Input Layer:** Receives input patterns.
- **Hidden Layer(s):** Main processing; feature extraction.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final result.

<br>

## Main Concepts and Key Formulas

- **Neuron Activation:**
  
  $a = \sum_{i=1}^{p} w_i X_i$
  
- **Output:**
  
  $y = f(a)$, where $f$ is the activation function (e.g., sigmoid, tanh)
  
- **Error Calculation:**
  
  $e_k(n) = d_k(n) - y_k(n)$
  
- **Cost Function (Mean Squared Error):**
  
  $E(n) = \frac{1}{2} e_k^2(n)$
  
- **Weight Update (Gradient Descent):**
  
  $w_{kj}(n+1) = w_{kj}(n) + \eta \frac{\partial E(n)}{\partial w_{kj}}$
  
- **Backpropagation for Output Layer:**

  $\delta^{(2)}(t) = (d(t) - y(t)) \cdot f'^{(2)}(u)$

- **Backpropagation for Hidden Layer:**


```latex
delta_j^(1)(t) = ( sum_k [ delta_k^(2) * w_kj^(2) ] ) * f'^(1)( u_j^(1))
```

<br>

## Training: Two-Phase Process

### 1. Forward Phase

- Initialize learning rate $\eta$ and weight matrix $w$ with random values.  
- Present input to the first layer.  
- Each neuron in layer $i$ computes its output, which is passed to the next layer.  
- The final output is compared to the desired output.  
- The error for each output neuron is calculated.

**Example Calculation:**

### Forward Computation Example

For input values:

- \( X_0 = 1 \)
- \( X_1 = 0.43 \)
- \( X_2 = 0.78 \)

And example weights:

- \( w^{(1)}_{00} = 0.45 \)
- \( w^{(1)}_{01} = 0.89 \)
- etc.


**Compute the activations and outputs for each layer using an activation function (e.g.,** `tanh`**):**

<p>Compute pre-activation (input to each hidden neuron):</p>
<p>$$
u_j^{(1)} = \sum_i X_i \cdot w_{ji}^{(1)}
$$</p>

- **Compute activation (output from each hidden neuron):**

  $y^{(1)}_j = \tanh(u^{(1)}_j)$

- Compute output layer pre-activation:  
  $u^{(2)} = \sum_j y^{(1)}_j w^{(2)}_j$
  
- Output of network:  
  $y^{(2)} = \tanh(u^{(2)})$

- Calculate error:  
  $e = d - y^{(2)}$  
  $E = \frac{1}{2} e^2$

<br>

### 2. Backward Phase (Backpropagation)

- Start from the output layer.  
- Each node adjusts its weight to reduce its error.  
- For hidden layers, the error is determined by the weighted errors of the next layer (chain rule).

- Output layer weight update:  

  $w^{(2)}(t+1) = w^{(2)}(t) + \eta \delta^{(2)} y^{(1)}(t)$  
  
  where $\delta^{(2)}(t) = (d(t) - y(t)) \cdot f'^{(2)}(u)$

- Hidden layer delta:

 ```latex
  $\delta^{(1)}_j(t) = \left( \sum_k \delta^{(2)}_k w^{(2)}_{kj} \right) \cdot f'^{(1)}(u_j)$
```

<br>

## Example: Training a Two-Layer Perceptron

1. **Initialize all weights randomly.**
2. **Present an input vector $X$.**
3. **Compute outputs for the first (hidden) layer:**
   
$u_j^{(1)} = \sum_i X_i w_{ji}^{(1)}$

$y_j^{(1)} = \tanh(u_j^{(1)})$


   
4. **Compute output for the second (output) layer:**

   $u^{(2)} = \sum_j y^{(1)}_j \cdot w^{(2)}_j$

   $y^{(2)} = \tanh(u^{(2)})$

5. **Calculate error:**

   $e = d - y^{(2)}$

   $E = \frac{1}{2} e^2$

6. **Backward phase:**

   - Compute $\delta^{(2)}$ and update output weights.
   - Compute $\delta^{(1)}$ for each hidden neuron and update hidden weights.

  <br>

## Why Two Layers and 3â€“5 Neurons per Layer?

- **Theoretical Power:** Two-layer MLPs can approximate any continuous function (universal approximation theorem).
- **Practical Simplicity:** Most real-world problems rarely require more than two layers.
- **Cost-Benefit:** 3â€“5 neurons per layer often provide sufficient capacity for generalization without excessive computational cost.


<br>

## Local Maximum (Local Maxima)

In gradient descent training, the algorithm updates weights to reduce error by following the gradient of the cost function. However, the cost function may have multiple local maxima or minima. 

- **Local Maximum:** A point where the cost function has a peak relative to nearby points but is not the absolute highest point globally.
- Gradient descent can get "stuck" in local maxima or minima, preventing the network from reaching the best possible solution.
- Techniques such as random restarts, momentum, or advanced optimization algorithms help mitigate this problem.


<br>

## Usage

Artificial Neural Networks, especially perceptrons and MLPs, are widely used in various domains due to their adaptability and ability to model complex nonlinear relationships.

### Strengths

- Ability to learn from examples and generalize to unseen data.
- Fault tolerance and robustness to noisy inputs.
- Flexibility to model complex, nonlinear functions.
- Parallel processing capability.

### Weaknesses

- Training can be computationally expensive, especially for large networks.
- Susceptible to getting stuck in local minima or maxima.
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, number of neurons, layers).
- Lack of interpretability compared to simpler models.


<br>

## Additional Relevant Points

### Learning Rate (Î·) Importance

The learning rate $\eta$ controls the step size during weight updates:

- If $\eta$ is too large, the training may overshoot minima and fail to converge.
- If $\eta$ is too small, training will be very slow and may get stuck in local minima.
- Adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., learning rate decay, Adam optimizer) can improve convergence.

### Activation Functions

While the document mentions sigmoid and tanh, it is useful to note:

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**  
  Widely used in modern neural networks for faster convergence and to mitigate vanishing gradient problems.
  
- **Softmax:**  
  Commonly used in output layers for multi-class classification problems.

### Overfitting and Regularization

- Neural networks with too many parameters can overfit training data, performing poorly on unseen data.
- Techniques such as early stopping, dropout, and L2 regularization help improve generalization.

### Batch vs. Online Learning

- The document discusses iterative weight updates per sample (online/stochastic gradient descent).
- In practice, **batch** or **mini-batch** gradient descent is often used for computational efficiency and stability.

### Practical Considerations

- Data preprocessing (normalization, encoding) is crucial for effective training.
- Initialization of weights affects convergence speed and final performance.
- Monitoring training with validation sets helps detect overfitting.
