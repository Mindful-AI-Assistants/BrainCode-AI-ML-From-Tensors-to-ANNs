# ðŸ§   Made of Code: Machine Learning Regression with Gradient Descent and Stochastic Optimization

<br>








<br>

This project demonstrates how to train a Linear Regression model using both Batch Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The implementation includes Python code, dataset, and detailed visualizations to illustrate convergence behavior, performance comparison, and optimization dynamics.

Ideal for beginners and intermediate learners looking to understand the foundations of machine learning optimization algorithms.
